# Pokédex App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

When running this project, you will be shown a random pokémon and a subset of its attributes. You can also search for a particular pokémon to view its attributes, using the open source Pokémon API.

## Getting Started

- Configure environment variables, copy `.env.local.example` to a new file named `.env.local`: `cp .env.local.example .env.local`
- Install packages with `npm i`
- Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
